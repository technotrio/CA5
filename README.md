Instructions:

Clone the Repository:

Clone the GitHub repository (CA5) to your local machine if you haven't already.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Create a docker-compose.yml File:

If a docker-compose.yml file doesn't already exist, create one in the root of your project directory. This file will define the services and use Docker images from Docker Hub. Here's an example of what it might look like:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: <team_member_2_web_service_image>
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  database:
    image: <team_member_3_database_service_image>
Replace <team_member_2_web_service_image> and <team_member_3_database_service_image> with the actual Docker Hub image references provided by your team members.

Configure Environment Variables (if needed):

If your Docker Compose stack requires environment variables, add them to the docker-compose.yml file or use a separate .env file. Make sure that the required environment variables are appropriately set for your services.
Run the Docker Compose Stack:

Open a terminal in the project directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.

To start the Docker Compose stack, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
The -d flag runs the services in the background (detached mode). Omit it if you want to see the logs in the terminal.
Docker Compose will pull the specified images from Docker Hub (if not already downloaded) and start the services.

Access Your Services:

Once the Docker Compose stack is up and running, you can access your services as defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

For the web service, you should be able to access it at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

Manage the Docker Compose Stack:

To stop and remove the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
To view the logs for the services, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs
Collaboration and Troubleshooting:

Communicate with your team members to ensure that the Docker images and the docker-compose.yml file are correctly configured.
If you encounter issues, review the logs and collaborate with your team members to troubleshoot and resolve them.
